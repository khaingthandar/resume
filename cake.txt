<h3>Remote Repositories</h3>
<p>https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git. To push our local repo to the GitHub server we'll need to add a remote repository.

<p>This command takes a remote name and a repository URL, which in your case is https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git.

<p>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Pushing Remotely</h3>
<p>The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready, and boy we're ready. So let's push our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub).</p>

<p>The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Go ahead and push it!</p>

<p>$ git push -u origin master</p>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Pulling Remotely</h3>
<p>Let's pretend some time has passed. We've invited other people to our GitHub project who have pulled your changes, made their own commits, and pushed them.</p>

<p>We can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes by running:</p>

<p>$ git pull origin master</p>
